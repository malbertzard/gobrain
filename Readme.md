# Brainfuck Interpreter in Go

This is a simple Brainfuck interpreter implemented in Go. The interpreter reads Brainfuck code, executes it step by step, and displays the memory tape and pointer's state after each step. It also shows the action executed in each step and the current output of the program.

## How to Run

1. Install Go if you haven't already: [https://golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install)

2. Clone the repository or create a new Go file with the provided code.

3. Run the program by executing the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   go run main.go
   ```

   Replace `main.go` with the name of the Go file you created.

4. The program will execute the example Brainfuck code provided in the code. You can modify the `brainfuckCode` variable in the `main` function to run your own Brainfuck code.

## Features

- The interpreter displays the memory tape and pointer's position after each step of execution.
- It shows the action executed in each step, such as incrementing the pointer, decrementing the value, outputting a character, and more.
- The interpreter collects the output of the Brainfuck program and displays it as the code executes.

## Customization

- You can modify the `brainfuckCode` variable in the `main` function to run any Brainfuck code you'd like.
- You can adjust the delay between each step by modifying the value in the `time.Sleep` function.

## Dependencies

- This program uses the standard Go library for most of its functionality and does not require additional external libraries.
